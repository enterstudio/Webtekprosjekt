README for studentguiden, the ultimate guide to Trondheim for students.

a. Form Controls
"Budsjettkalkulator"
We used forms to accept integer and a string input from the user on our calculator.
With the exception of name field for "utgifter", the fields only accept positive integers.

b. CSS
We have used css on every page to make them look nicer. All the pages have a consistent look and feel with a navbar on top, page content in the middle and a footer at the bottom. Most of our CSS is in a stylesheet, but we have used some style tag CSS and inline CSS for unique cases such as image sizing. 

c. XML
"Sitemap"
We have used xml for our sitemap.

d. Client-side Programming: Javascript
The header on every page
We have javascript for a welcome script on our site, that changes depending on the time of day it is.

The frontpage
The frontpage uses javascript for its image slider that's made with <canvas>.

"Budsjett"
The "budsjettkalkulator" uses javascript to add "utgifter" to a unordered list, in addition to take in values from "budsjett" and "utgift" forms
and subtract "utgifter" from "budsjett" and adding the sum to the div "sum".

"Matpriser"
Uses javascript to sort in a table with food prices, putting the row with the listing lowest to highest price for the product selected.

"Kart"
The map page implements Google Maps API v3 and includes markers with som basic information about the location. There are also some buttons for easily finding a location in the map. We wanted a map on our site and the Google Maps API is well documented and a good way to include javascript in our page.
