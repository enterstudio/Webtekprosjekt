a. Form Controls
"Budsjettkalkulator"
We used forms to accept integer and a string input from the user on our calculator.
With the exception of name field for "utgifter", the fields only accept positive integers.

b. CSS

c. XML
"Sitemap.xml"
We used xml to structure our sitemap, in addition to some css to not make it look terrible.
Why? Because we had to use some XML, and the sitemap felt like natural choice. Despite not knowing how to make links in it.

d. Client-side Programming: Javascript
The header on every page
We have javascript for a welcome script on our site, that changes depending on the time of day it is.

The frontpage
The frontpage uses javascript for its image slider that's made with <canvas>.

"Budsjett"
The "budsjettkalkulator" uses javascript to add "utgifter" to a unordered list, in addition to take in values from "budsjett" and "utgift" forms
and subtract "utgifter" from "budsjett" and adding the sum to the div "sum".

"Matpriser"
Uses javascript to sort in a table with food prices, putting the row with the listing lowest to highest price for the product selected.
