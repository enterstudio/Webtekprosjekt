README for studentguiden, the ultimate guide to Trondheim for students.

a. Form Controls
"Budsjettkalkulator"
We used forms to accept integer and a string input from the user on our calculator.
With the exception of name field for "utgifter", the fields only accept positive integers.

b. CSS
We have used css on every page to make them look nicer. All the pages have a consistent look and feel with a navbar
 on top, page content in the middle and a footer at the bottom. Most of our CSS is in a stylesheet, but we have used 
some style tag CSS and inline CSS for unique cases such as image sizing. 

c. XML
"Sitemap"
We have used xml to create our sitemap for a more dynamic approch. We have a xml-file in our project with information about all the different categories
and subpages with links which is being used by a javascript to create the sitemap. If a subpage or category is added to the xml-file, the script will
generate html code according to the given file.

d. Client-side Programming: Javascript
Message on navigation bar
We have used a javascript for creating a dynamic message in the navigation bar that changes depending on the time of day it is.

Forms and javascript
The "budsjettkalkulator" uses javascript to add "utgifter" to a unordered list, in addition to take in values from "budsjett" and "utgift" forms
and subtract "utgifter" from "budsjett" and adding the sum to the div "sum".

Sortable table
We have used javascript for creating a table that can be sorted on prices of different products in different grocery-stores
by clicking on the differnt products.

Google Maps API v3
The map page implements Google Maps API v3 and includes markers with som basic information about the location. There are also some buttons for easily finding a location in the map. We wanted a map on our site and the Google Maps API is well documented and a good way to include javascript in our page.

Canvas
For making a "slideshow" on the first page we have used the canvas tag and it's javascript api to draw images and animations
of slides.
